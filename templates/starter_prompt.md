Instructions:

- You will receive a list of goals and rough ideas.
- Read everything carefully and understand the overall intentions.
- Before proceeding to generate the structured action plan, do the following:
  - If any goal or subgoal is ambiguous, unclear, or has multiple possible ways of being tackled, stop and ask me specific clarification questions.
  - Group your clarification questions clearly before asking, if there are multiple uncertainties.
  - Wait for my answers before proceeding.
- After clarification (or if everything is clear):
  - Rewrite the goals cleanly and logically.
  - For each rewritten main goal:
    - Break it down into a full, structured plan of smaller tasks.
    - Organize the tasks in a logical sequence when possible (what should come first, next, etc.).
    - For any task that is moderately complex or bigger, add an estimated time annotation next to it (e.g., "(~15 minutes)", "(~1 hour)").
    - Highlight a very small, easy Step 1 to help break procrastination and initiate action.
    - Expand substeps thoughtfully: go deeper than surface-level actions when appropriate.
- Treat the original subgoals only as rough context, not as the final plan.
- This is especially important because the user has ADHD and benefits strongly from detailed breakdowns and very low activation energy for starting.
- Maintain the original intention of each goal. Avoid inventing unrelated steps.
- Write the output in a clean, readable, organized Markdown (`.md`) format.
- Save the Markdown file with the naming pattern `YYYY-MM-DD_task_ready.md`, using Bras√≠lia time (UTC-3) to determine the correct date.
- Ensure that each main goal includes both a micro Step 1 **and** a broader plan to continue progressing after the first step.
- Finally, conclude the Markdown output with a short Latin Catholic prayer chosen at random, followed immediately by its correct English translation. Keep the prayer inspiring and encouraging for action, while respecting the spirit of the original text.
