## Core idea behind ***Resolvr***
You create simple markdown files (daily or weekly).
Inside them, you brain-dump tasks, thoughts, or goals.

Then Resolvr (your script + ChatGPT) helps you process that raw list into:
1. Top priorities (what really matters now)
2. First steps (micro-actions to destroy procrastination inertia)
